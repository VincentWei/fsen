FSEN is built on [Concreate5](http://www.concrete5.org) V5.6.3.2, which is one of the most popular CMS system in the world.

Concrete5 is a general-purpose CMS sytem, while FSEN is built for the open source projects.

* Sociability. All sections posted by the users can be commented, praised by others. Any visitors of the site can share the sections to social networks.

## Goal of FSEN

Initially, we launch FSEN as an open source project, because we want to build a better open source community (the site www.fullstackengineer.net) to host another open source projects - Open Cloud API.

However, we hope FSEN can be used for any purpose which is suitable. We will continue developing FSEN as an open source project. Of course, the www.FullStackEngineer.Net site also welcome to host other open source projects!
